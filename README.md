# egsa87
Functions to convert geodetic coordinates from the [World Geodetic System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) 1984 (**WGS84**) to the [Hellenic Geodetic Reference System 1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_Geodetic_Reference_System_1987) (**HGRS87/EGSA87**) Greek geodetic system and vice versa.

The Matlab directory contains Matlab implementations; C ports of the same functions are in directory ./C
Furthermore, a Python folder contains the corresponding implementation.

Code is based on the [icoordstrans](https://github.com/skozan/icoordstrans) library.
